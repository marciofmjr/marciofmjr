### Hi there 🧑🏻‍💻

My name is Marcio Junior, I'm 26 years old, I'm living on Brazil 🇧🇷.

#### About me 💬
I love development and technological things since I was a kid, I always liked computer and discovering new things. I have a special affection for the areas of **front-end**, **usability**, **design**, **software architecture**, **user experience**, **artificial intelligence**, new things and more.

#### Working 🖥️
I'm currently working at [SHIFT 🧪 🖥️](https://shift.com.br), in the most part of the time we work with [Intersystems](https://www.intersystems.com/br/) technologies

#### Studing 📚
I'm currently studying [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), to learn a different framework, and I chose vue because I believe it's a little more simple than Angular and React. Could be very interest when you need to build small projects and you need agility and productivity
